This development award will enable the project leadership team to guide all regional partners and collaborators through a 24-month process of co-creation of ideas, strategies and innovations. Through these activities, the project leadership will build a diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem that drives economic growth, workforce development, use-inspired research and development, and the translation of innovations to practice around the lithium lifecycle.

Our team will contribute on leading the educational efforts of this proposal for workforce development in the region and within the scope of the project.
