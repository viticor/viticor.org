The main goal of the project is to support the state of Nevada efforts in exploration and utilization of geothermal energy resources by closing the loop on the life cycle analysis of these activities. The main objectives of this project are:

    - Design and develop static and dynamic Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) scenarios and methods for  sustainable development of geothermal energy extraction and exploration projects in Northern Nevada.
    - Evaluate and demonstrate the LCA framework with case studies of interest for the region,  and possibly extend these to other renewable energy related activities in the region.
    
The methods and procedures to develop the LCA models follow the framework provided by the standards ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 14044:2006. We are conducting a LCA analysis on a base case study typical of the region (Blue Mountain “Faulkner 1”) and then follow with further analysis on scenarios for similar technologies and deployments in the region. We defined the geothermal systems into three stages: (a) exploration and drilling, (b) power production, and (c) post-production and re-cultivation.
