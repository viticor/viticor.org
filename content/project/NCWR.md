The scope of work for the proposed research has been divided into three phases, with the first two phases
planned for 18 months each and the final phase planned for 12 months. Over this time, the research team
will focus efforts on several core thrust areas that are central to the overarching theme of water resiliency
and self sufficiency:

- Design and planning for the Nevada Center for Water Resiliency
- Advanced water reuse technologies
- Alternative water sources for water reuse applications
- Resource recovery from impaired water sources
- Risk and systems engineering to foster water reuse

The focus of our team is on developing a water supply chain network model for understanding and adapting supply scenarios in areas with increasing demands of the resource due to increasing population and industrial use. The main goal of this task is to create the NV H2O -FLOW model, a digital network mapping of the water supply and aquatic resources in Northern Nevada. Network models consist of a series of interconnected nodes and links.

The main PIs of project are [Sage Hiibel](https://www.unr.edu/cme/people/sage-hiibel) and [Eric Marchand](https://www.unr.edu/cee/people/eric-marchand) from the 
[University of Nevada, Reno](https://unr.edu/).

Financial support for this project is provided by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).
