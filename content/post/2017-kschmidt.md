**Kevin M. Schmidt** from our research group successfully defended his dissertation titled "*Ab Initio* Studies of Metal Hexaboride Materials" on May 08, 2017. Here is an abstract of his dissertation:

## Abstract

Metal hexaborides are refractory ceramics displaying a variety of electronic properties related to
transport and spin states as the metal species are interchanged. A boron framework stitched
through covalent bonds provides structural rigidity allowing these materials to withstand
extreme operating conditions, while the particular choice of cation generally dictates the
electrical properties. This work utilizes a variety of computational tools to study various aspects
of these materials, including bulk dynamics, surface properties, hydrogen adsorption, and ternary
mixture stability.
