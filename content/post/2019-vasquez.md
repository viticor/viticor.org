## Description


During the Spring semester of 2019 the University of Nevada, Reno conducted the first Faculty Academic Leadership Program (FALP).   The FALP is intended for academic faculty that have an interest in pursuing leadership positions, at the department, school/college, or university level.  The program will focus on leadership and leadership styles.  It will also provide insight into the policies and procedures of UNR, the administrative structure of UNR, and UNRâ€™s relationship to stakeholders such as the Board of Regents, the legislature, private industry, and donors.
