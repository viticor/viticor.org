abstract = "We examine the importance of specific interfacial properties for the development of efficient cathode devices. In particular, we study the electrostatic behavior of BaB6, CaB66, LaB6, and SrB6 surfaces having various terminal configurations and surface coverage using a repeated symmetric slab model with self-consistent field calculations. The calculated work functions for each system are found minimal for a monolayer cation coverage and monotonically approach the experimental value for pure boron as cations are subsequently removed. Further examination of the bonding charge densities suggest the low work functions typically observed in these materials is due mainly to the electrical double layer formed at the surface, rather than an inherent bulk property. This provides evidence suggesting that a variety of experimental observations may be due to surface features resulting from different preparatory methods. Significant electron density shifts are observed only few atomic layers deep leaving most of the bulk material unaltered."
