abstract = "TThe purpose of this work is to evaluate the potential of modeling the self-diffusion coefficient (SDC) of real fluids in all fluid states based on Lennard?Jones analytical relationships involving the SDC, the temperature, the density and the pressure. For that, we generated an equation of state (EOS) that interrelates the self-diffusion coefficient, the temperature and the density of the Lennard?Jones (LJ) fluid. We fit the parameters of such LJ?SDC?EOS using recent wide ranging molecular simulation data for the LJ fluid. We also used in this work a LJ pressure?density?temperature EOS that we combined with the LJ?SDC?EOS to make possible the calculation of LJ?SDC values from given temperature and pressure. Both EOSs are written in terms of LJ dimensionless variables, which are defined in terms of the LJ parameters ? and ?. These parameters are meaningful at molecular level. By combining both EOSs, we generated LJ corresponding states charts which make possible to conclude that the LJ fluid captures the observed behavioral patterns of the self-diffusion coefficient of real fluids over a wide range of conditions. In this work, we also performed predictions of the SDC of real fluids in all fluid states. For that, we assumed that a given real fluid behaves as a Lennard?Jones fluid which exactly matches the experimental critical temperature Tc and the experimental critical pressure Pc of the real fluid. Such an assumption implies average true prediction errors of the order of 10% for vapors, light supercritical fluids, some dense supercritical fluids and some liquids. These results make possible to conclude that it is worthwhile to use the LJ fluid reference as a basis to model the self-diffusion coefficient of real fluids, over a wide range of conditions, without resorting to non-LJ correlations for the density?temperature?pressure relationship. The database considered here contains more than 1000 experimental data points. The database practical reduced temperature range is from 0.53 to 2.4, and the practical reduced pressure range is from 0 to 68.4."
