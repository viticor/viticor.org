abstract = "We have calculated the energetics of adsorption and diffusive behavior of hydrogen on metal hexaboride surfaces using a combination of self-consistent density-functional calculations and dynamics based on the Car-Parrinello method. Our results show that hydrogen adsorption is localized to exposed boron atoms, and interactions with the terminal cations are strictly repulsive.  Adsorption energies suggest that a single hydrogen molecule per surface unit-cell is possible.  Strongest bonds are found when hydrogen is above the terminal boron atoms affected by reduced coordination and dangling bonds.  This location serves to restore the hexaboride unit to a more stable structure by providing electronic density to the deficient surface octahedra.  Additionally, trajectories from dynamic simulations provide insight into how hydrogen recombination reactions occur on the surface through dissociative adsorption and migration pathways.  Upon adsorption, a single hydrogen atom becomes localized at the dangling bond site while the second interacts with the surface along a weaker potential energy path. Desorption at lower temperatures occurs when migrating atoms from separate adsorption sites intersect to form a new pair."
