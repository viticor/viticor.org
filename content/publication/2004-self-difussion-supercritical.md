abstract = "In this work, we propose a model for representing both the viscosity and the self diffusion coefficient (SDC) of supercritical pure fluids in wide ranges of conditions. A given pure real fluid is represented as a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid having efective values of the LJ intermolecular potential parameters. The model is able to represent the pure compound viscosity an self diffusion coefficient of real supercritical fluids, in wide ranges of conditions, with average absolute-value relative deviations less than or about 10 % for both properties."
