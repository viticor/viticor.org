title = "Energetics of Hydrogen Interactions on Hexaboride Surfaces: Experimental results and insights from DFT and CPMD Calculations"
abstract = "We discuss ab initio modeling results on the interaction of hydrogen on metal hexaboride surfaces. We quantify energies of absorption and discuss the mechanims observed from CPMD calculations including chemi- and physi-sorption phenomena depending the type of surface of the hexaboride material. We also presesent basic experimental characterization of the surface."
