title = "Current Effects on Atomic Displacements and Phonon Dissipation in Hexaboride Materials: A Raman Spectroscopy Study"
abstract = "We describe the role of an applied direct electric current on the atomic displacements of boron octahedra in hexaboride materials through a detailed analysis of the Raman active modes T2g , Ag , and Eg . We find that the applied current has a direct effect on these active modes, resulting in processes of expansion-contraction of the lattice as a carrier dissipation mechanism. A physical model to describe the observed phenomenon was developed using LaB6 and CeB6 single crystals."
